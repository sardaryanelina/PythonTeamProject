# PythonTeamProject

Development of Progressive Web Applications
Final Project Idea
Team: Elina Sardaryan, Aleecia Everett, Elise Bromberg

Our team will use tutorials from LinkedIn Learning and Udemy to learn the fundamentals of Python and Django. We will then create a basic registration page linked to a database. 

We expect to spend approximately 10-12 hours watching tutorials and 15 hours implementing the project. 

Oct. 13 – 14: Python tutorials
Oct. 15: Django and project tutorials
Oct. 16 – 18: Project implementation
Oct. 19 – 20: Fix bugs, finish implementation. 

We plan to use the following sources: 

LinkedIn Learning:
Learning Python (3h 10m)
Python Essential Training (4h 17m)
Learning Django (1h 40m)
Django Essential Training (2h 6m)
Python Projects (1h 30m)

Each team member will choose a Python tutorial and a Django tutorial in order to learn and understand the basics. We will all watch the projects video to practice implementation. 

Udemy: 
Python Django: Ultimate Beginners Course - 2022 (10h 38m)
100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 (64h 2m)

The Django course includes a tutorial for a registration page, which we will use to build our project. 

The Python Pro Bootcamp contains some extra projects that we may use if we have extra time, but we do not plan to watch the whole tutorial.

Project Responsibilities: 
GUI with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for login page: Aleecia
Database and Models: Elise
CRUD operations to add users, change passwords, etc.: Elina

Responsibilities may be adjusted as we learn more about the work required or if we add pages/functionality to the website.
